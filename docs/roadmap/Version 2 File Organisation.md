# Version 2, File Organisation
A large amounts of the files in this version may not be in use at the current time but may be needed later on.
To combat this issue I have decided to add some of these files and code them up so they are ready when needed

## What files are not important now?
<span style="color:red">classes/badges/*</span> *file may be used*
<span style="color:red">classes/Badge.ts</span> *file may be used*
<span style="color:teal">types/blacklistData.ts</span> *file may be used*
<span style="color:teal">types/random.ts</span> *file may be used*
<span style="color:teal">types/ranked.ts</span> *file may be used*
<span style="color:teal">types/staffRanks.ts</span> *file may be used*

All files tagged with *file may be used* are used for some reason inside of the code, this is mostly future proofing
